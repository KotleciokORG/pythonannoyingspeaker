Saying some sentences, dont stop it, but its not best

gtasa.py is the main script. 

pyinstaller --hidden-import=pyttsx3.drivers.sapi5 --onefile gtasa.py --noconsole --icon=ikona.ico
this for changing it to .exe
change website address to set another sentence to say.

problems:
-sometimes it doesnt start to say sentence
-when runned from startup, have some problems to work properly

only educational purpouses :)
